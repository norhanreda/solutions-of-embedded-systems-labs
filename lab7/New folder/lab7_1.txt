/*
Req #1
It is required to to generate a fixed non inverted 500 Hz PWM signal with 20% duty ratio
on PE14 and enable the Buzzer.
Hints:
Donâ€™t forget to include the PWM library from library manager
To find out what timer and channel to work with you can use code assistant
Type _GPIO_MODULE_TIM
Press CTRL + SPACE
Search for PE14
